			<h1>Hi, Iâ€™m Nathan<br/></h1>
			<p>A Nuclear Engineering Grad student at the University of Illinois Urbana-Chapmaign</p>
		</header>
		<p>Working in the <a href="https://arfc.github.io" target="_blank">Advanced Reactors and Fuel Cycles group</a>, my research focuses on developing fuel cycle transitions for advanced reactors and energy system model optimization of peaceful non-energy applications of nuclear power. In my free time, I enjoy cooking with my family, advocating for nuclear energy, painting cartoon animals, and trying to keep my plants alive.</p>
		<p></p>
		<p>
			I have a whole page of resources (it's mostly so I have a place to store sites and materials I refer people to a lot), but if you are an underrepresented person in STEM interested in developing your computational skills you should check out the <a href="https://www.cranephysics.org/" target="_blank">CRANE</a> bootcamp!

		<h2>This week in US nuclear energy searches</h2>
		<p>As more and more of our lives takes place online, I think it's important to highlight where people are thinking about nuclear and what they're looking for information on!</p>

		<script type="text/javascript" src="https://ssl.gstatic.com/trends_nrtr/3601_RC01/embed_loader.js"></script>
		<script type="text/javascript">
		  trends.embed.renderExploreWidget("GEO_MAP", {"comparisonItem":[{"keyword":"Nuclear energy","geo":"US","time":"now 7-d"}],"category":0,"property":""}, {"exploreQuery":"date=now%207-d&geo=US&q=Nuclear%20energy&hl=en-US","guestPath":"https://trends.google.com:443/trends/embed/"});
		</script>

		<p>It amazes me every week how some of these results make sense based on where nuclear programs are located, and sometimes I have no idea why a particular region is looking up all things nuclear. Here are some rising questions people are looking up, these aren't the top questions (but those were pretty constant, so I thought this would be more interesting).</p>

		<script type="text/javascript" src="https://ssl.gstatic.com/trends_nrtr/3601_RC01/embed_loader.js"></script>
		<script type="text/javascript">
		  trends.embed.renderExploreWidget("GEO_MAP", {"comparisonItem":[{"keyword":"Nuclear energy","geo":"US","time":"2023-12-29 2024-01-05"}],"category":0,"property":""}, {"exploreQuery":"date=2023-12-29%202024-01-05&geo=US&q=Nuclear%20energy&hl=en-US","guestPath":"https://trends.google.com:443/trends/embed/"});
		</script>


		<p>None of this would be complete without some related topics. Looking at what people are relating to nuclear energy is similarly a wild ride for me (there are some things I just can't explain)</p>
