			<h1>Hi, Iâ€™m Nathan<br/></h1>
			<p>A Nuclear Engineering Grad student at the University of Illinois Urbana-Chapmaign</p>
		</header>
		<p>Working in the <a href="https://arfc.github.io" target="_blank">Advanced Reactors and Fuel Cycles group</a>, my research focuses on developing fuel cycle transitions for advanced reactors and energy system model optimization of peaceful non-energy applications of nuclear power. In my free time, I enjoy cooking with my family, advocating for nuclear energy, painting cartoon animals, and trying to keep my plants alive.</p>
		<p></p>
		<p>
			I have a whole page of resources (it's mostly so I have a place to store sites and materials I refer people to a lot), but if you are an underrepresented person in STEM interested in developing your computational skills you should check out the <a href="https://www.cranephysics.org/" target="_blank">CRANE</a> bootcamp!

		<h2>A video from my travels</h2>
		<p>Two turtles chilling on the black sand beach. They were largely asleep, though they would occasionally move their head around. The water is lapping behind them, and they were cordoned off from the public.</p>
