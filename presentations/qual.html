                <p>At Illinois NPRE, our first official milestone is a qualifying exam. The last part of our qual is an oral defense, expansion, and critique of an assigned paper. Given that we are provided less than a week to prepare, I cannot say these slides are perfect (or that they represent my typical standards for a slide deck). For this presentation, I experimented with a web version of a slide template used by my advisor for interactive slides. The presentation I gave was going directly from left to right in the deck, and the slides in other directions were backups for questions.</p>
