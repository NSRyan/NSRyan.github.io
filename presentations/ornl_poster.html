                <h2>The Nuclear Fuel Cycle</h2>
                <p>The nuclear fuel cycle describes everything that happens to nuclear fuel and its supporting components from cradle to grave.A once-through fuel cycle (what we have for commercial fuel in the US) does not incorporate recycling, and has the fuel come from the mine and go through preparation facilities before being used in a reactor and disposed of. This is not the only fuel cycle, other countries recycle their fuel by incorporating a step called reprocessing.</p>

                <h2>Cyclus</h2>
                <p>Cyclus is an agent-based nuclear fuel cycle simulator that is incredibly versatile, one of the initial core developers (Professor Katy Huff) likes to say that, "Cyclus can be used to model any process from making a grilled-cheese to international nuclear fuel cycles." The software achieves this versatility through a series of generic archetypes that are primarily transaction based. Over the years, the user community and developers have created a litany of nuclear specific archetypes for everything from proliferation assessment to fuel burnup, our contribution to the ecosystem falls under this category with EVER and CLOVER.</p>

                <h3>EVER</h3>
                <p>The <a href="https://github.com/nsryan2/NEAR/tree/main/EVER">Enrichment Versatile non-Equilibrium Reactor (EVER)</a> archetype, in its lowest fidelity case, functions almost exactly like the <a href="https://fuelcycle.org/user/cycamoreagents.html#cycamore-reactor">Cycamore</a> reactor. To compare, we have deployed EVER with a Cycamore reactor using preferences to achieve the same result and a Cycamore reactor with a single input recipe. In this flow path, the user defines each fuel recipe based on external depletion calculations and brings that information to Cyclus.</p>
                <p></p>

                <h3>CLOVER</h3>
                <p>The <a href="https://github.com/nsryan2/NEAR/tree/main/CLOVER">Core LOading Versatile non-Equilibrium Reactor (CLOVER)</a> archetype, in its lowest fidelity case, introduces a new capability to Cyclus by allowing the user explicit control over assemblies inside of a particular batch of fuel entering a reactor core. The user interacts with this lowest fidelity functionality will by defining the recipe they want to apply to each fuel assembly, and the location of each assembly. Then they define the times at which the reactor will move to the next configuration, and are able to run the simulation like normal from there.</p>

                <h3>NEAR</h3>
                <p>The end-goal of this work is to create the Non-Equilibrium Archetypal Reactor (NEAR), which will allow users to take advantage of both features simultaneously.</p>

                <h2>Example Scenario</h2>
                <p>In the example deployment scenario, we deploy the Cycamore reactor alongside EVER for comparison in a simplified fuel cycle. The three reacotors deployed in this scenario have slightly different roles:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>"Base_Reactor" is a classic, once recipe, deployment of the cycamore reactor.</li>
                    <li>"Base_Pref_Reactor" uses preferences to toggle between a lower and higher enrichment fuel to achieve the variation from EVER.</li>
                    <li>"EVER_Update_Reactor" is the EVER reactor, which toggles fuel recipes at the same time as the preference reactor.</li>
                </ol>
                <img src="../images/presentations/24_ornl_poster/ever_map.png" width="85%">
                <p></p>
                <p>We can confirm that the Cycamore reactor that uses preferences and EVER function individually by creating a scenario where they both start by accepting fresh UOx fuel, move to some other fuel (HALEU), and then back to fresh UOx. All told, we can track the total fabricated fuel and see the impact of these changes.</p>

                <p></p>
                <p>In addition to SWU, these additions will give us a more versatile ability to model the isotopic composition in used fuel.</p>

                <p>The analysis of this scenario is available in a <a href="https://github.com/nsryan2/NEAR/blob/main/EVER/update/ever_update_test_analysis.ipynb">jupyter notebook</a> on github .</p>
