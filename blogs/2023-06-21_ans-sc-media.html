						<p>Welcome to social media management for an American Nuclear Society (ANS) student section! In this digital landscape, it's essential to establish an online presence and effectively engage with your audience. To help you navigate these uncharted waters, I've compiled a practical list of rules and best practices.</p>

						<h2>1. Sharing the Burden: Collaboration for Active Accounts</h2>

							Maintaining active social media accounts requires consistent effort. If you find it challenging to keep up with weekly postings on a majority of your platforms, don't hesitate to enlist the help of your secretary or other team members for assistance. Remember, having active accounts is crucial for staying connected with your audience. The recommended daily maximums are 1 Facebook post, 15 tweets, and 1 Instagram post.
						<p></p>

						<h2>2. Follow the Risk Communication Model: First, Right, and Credible</h2>

							When sharing information, remember the risk communication model: be the first to communicate important news, ensure your content is accurate and reliable, and maintain credibility. Prioritize fact-checking and verify the source of information before sharing or retweeting.
						</p>

						<p>
						<h2>3. Authenticity and Fact-Checking: The Source Matters</h2>

							When you come across news or updates, go to the primary source. Read any relevant links thoroughly before sharing or retweeting.
						<p></p>

						<h2>4. Consent and Minors: Respecting Privacy Boundaries</h2>

							Exercise caution when posting content featuring minors. It's crucial to obtain explicit consent from their guardians before sharing anything. I avoid posting content with minors, even with a guardian's consent.
						<p></p>

						<h2>5. Semi-political Neutrality and Legislative Matters</h2>

							Maintain political neutrality on many, not all, non-nuclear-related topics--there is plenty of room for advocating for your members on all manner of political subjects. On nuclear matters, see if ANS National has guidance on addressing legislation before putting together content. Your role should primarily focus on informing people about the existence of legislation or encouraging them to exercise their right to vote.
						</p>

						<p>
						<h2>6. Embrace the Power of Community: Be Kind and Supportive</h2>

							Remember that the nuclear community is relatively small, so be kind and respectful to everyone you interact with. Building positive relationships within the community will enhance your reputation and create a supportive environment for your student section.
						<p></p>

						<h2>7. #HashtagEtiquette: Capitalize for Accessibility</h2>

							Increase the accessibility of your hashtags by capitalizing the first letter of each word; for example, instead of #bluebunny, use #BlueBunny. This adjustment can make a big difference for individuals using assistive technologies.
						<p></p>

						<h2>8. Strategic Hashtag Usage: Quality over Quantity</h2>

							When using hashtags, less is often more. Stick to a limited number of relevant hashtags for each post. According to Buffer: on Twitter, one to three hashtags work best, while on Facebook, hashtags may actually decrease engagement. Using 11 or more hashtags per Instagram post often yields the most post engagement (I've found that excessive). But regularly assess the quality of your hashtags by seeing what your mutuals are using for similar content.
						<p></p>

						<h2>9. The Art of Memes: Appropriate and Inoffensive Fun</h2>

							Memes are a fantastic way to engage your audience, but exercise caution. Ensure that memes are appropriate and relatively unoffensive. Remember, you have more freedom than ANS National or a company, but avoid crossing the line into excessive "shitposting."
						</p>

						<p>
						<h2>10. Regularly Review the Accounts You Follow</h2>

							Periodically check the content shared by the accounts you follow. Ensure that it aligns with your student section's values and objectives. A semesterly review can help maintain your feed and ensure you're comfortable with the content you may be associated with.
						<p></p>

						<p>
							<h2>11. Organic Growth and Engagement: Avoid Asking for Likes and Follows</h2>

							Refrain from explicitly asking people to like or follow your social media accounts. Focus on creating valuable content that naturally attracts engagement and fosters organic growth.
						</p>

						<p>
							<h2>12. Embrace the "We" Mentality: First Person Plural Pronouns</h2>

							In your social media communication, try using first-person plural pronouns like "we" to create a sense of inclusivity and unity. However, using the first-person singular pronoun "I" is occasionally acceptable.
						</p>

						<p>
							<h2>13. Extend Your Reach: Cross-Posting Stories</h2>

							For Instagram, ensure that your posts immediately go up on both Instagram and Facebook stories. This cross-posting strategy will maximize your reach and engagement across platforms.
						</p>
						<p>
							<h2>14. Give Credit Where It's Due: Mention and Tag Creators</h2>

							When sharing someone else's content, give credit where it's due. Mention and tag the creators in your posts.
						</p>

						<p>
							<h2>15. Respect Privacy: Tag with Permission</h2>

							Be cautious when tagging individuals on your social media accounts. Always obtain permission before tagging someone in your posts to respect their privacy and personal boundaries.
						</p>

						<p>
							<h2>16. The 75/25 Rule: Balancing Engagement and Promotion</h2>

							Strike a balance in your content mix. Approximately 75% of your posts should aim to engage and entertain your audience, while the remaining 25% can promote your student section's activities and initiatives.
						</p>

						<p>
							<h2>17. Authenticity Over Numbers: Never Buy Followers</h2>

							Above all, prioritize authenticity and genuine connections. Never resort to purchasing followers. Focus on cultivating an engaged audience that shares your passion for nuclear science and fosters meaningful interactions.
						</p>

						<p>
							<h2>18. Planning Ahead and Scheduling are Your Friends</h2>

							Depending on the platform's capabilities, drafting or planning posts ahead of time will allow you to make the most out of your content (using it in multiple ways without being redundant). I would plan a semester's worth of content to meet a bare minimum of twice-a-week engagement, and then passively monitor while school was on-going to get the numbers up.
						</p>
					<p>
							By adhering to these rules and best practices, you'll be well-equipped to navigate the ever-evolving world of social media for your American Nuclear Society student section. Engage, inspire, and create an online presence that reflects the vibrant energy of your student community. Happy posting!
