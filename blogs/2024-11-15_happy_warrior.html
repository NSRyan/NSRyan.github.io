                        <p>
                            I have heard this phrase, the “happy warrior,” used
                            to describe several politicians and bureaucrats,
                            but the image of a happy warrior doesn’t have to
                            solely exist in the political sphere. I have worked
                            for amazing communicators who embody this
                            archetype, and I have been at conferences where
                            these people abound. This whole article could be a
                            rehash of Rhetoric 101. I never took that class (I
                            wish I had in undergrad)… so let's look at this
                            archetype and how we can be a happy nuclear warrior.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            If you haven’t heard the phrase before, the happy
                            warrior is a persona device wherein the speaker
                            imparts a sense of optimism and confidence to their
                            audience. This device is the most successful when
                            your audience leaves thinking the speaker is
                            optimistic and confident and feeling that way
                            themselves. My introduction to the phrase was in
                            high school when we read William Wordsworth’s poem
                            “Character of the Happy Warrior” (no I did not
                            remember the name off the top of my head, I
                            absolutely had to look it up when I was writing
                            this), and—from what Merriam-Webster told me—this
                            is the origin of the phrase. Wordsworth ascribed
                            natural discernment, diligence in learning, resolve
                            in the face of fear, and self-awareness to the
                            image of the happy warrior. Is this person single?
                            I’d like to know.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            We can hopefully start painting the picture of
                            someone you know by translating these traits to
                            public speaking. The easiest way to identify a
                            happy nuclear warrior is to check in with your
                            response to their speech. I would encourage you to
                            seek these people out and identify on an
                            intellectual level what you like about their
                            communication style—don’t be afraid to take notes,
                            I started this blog from notes I made while
                            listening to Rita Baranwal talk at a conference.
                            Formalizing my thoughts on this device has helped
                            the way I approach speaking, and it will hopefully
                            help you too; the only downside is that this might
                            drive you crazy listening to talks by people who
                            haven’t put as much effort into developing their
                            own rhetorical persona.
                        </p>

                        <h2>Becoming a Happy Warrior</h2>

                        <p>
                            I would like to believe that some people naturally
                            develop the happy warrior rhetorical persona
                            through trial and error, but, to get results in
                            anything, it’s best to practice. Let’s revisit some
                            of the traits that Wordsworth ascribed to the happy
                            warrior:
                        </p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>natural discernment,</li>
                            <li>diligence in learning,</li>
                            <li>resolve in the face of fear,</li>
                            <li>and self awareness.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <p>
                            These traits undergird that sense of optimism and
                            confidence that you’re hoping to bring to your
                            speech, so you have to start by building up your
                            own familiarity with the topic you are going to be
                            speaking on. One of the first pieces of outreach
                            advice I received was that to communicate a subject
                            simply you have to know the material intimately. I
                            don’t know if the literature on science
                            communication would totally agree, but gaming
                            through the questions you think people will ask and
                            workshopping how to answer them is an important
                            step in how I prepare myself. Natural discernment
                            comes in by knowing what the limits of your
                            knowledge are, and diligence in learning is how you
                            get there. These two traits are the most
                            straightforward to work toward; one way you can
                            probe the edges of your knowledge is to keep asking
                            yourself why until you hit a wall. Resolve in the
                            face of fear and self-awareness are a little harder
                            for me to describe—probably because I haven’t
                            convinced myself that I’m there yet and am maybe
                            hoping this brief introspective aside convinces you
                            I have a shred of self-awareness.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            In the moment, after you’ve done all of the
                            preparation and built up your own skills, the
                            biggest difference I have experienced from being in
                            the room with happy warriors is they project their
                            own excitement into the room. That excitement is
                            contagious, and effective happy warriors is that
                            they fill the room by projecting but not yelling.
                            If you’re speaking into a microphone, make sure it
                            is just below level with your mouth and not too
                            close; ideally about 2 inches away from your mouth,
                            but experiment a little if there are monitors on
                            the stage for you to hear how you sound. Often it
                            is not the case that you will have monitors unless
                            you are on a large stage, but try to get a sense of
                            how loud you will sound to the audience by
                            listening to other speakers if you have the option.
                            If you are using a clip-on, keep it roughly 6
                            inches below your chin, avoid any ties or
                            necklaces, don’t tap your chest in a way that will
                            rustle, and keep your arms away from the cord that
                            connects the mic to the pack.
                        </p>


                        <h2>Speaking Like a Happy Warrior</h2>

                        <p>
                            While the Happy Warrior isn't the only rhetorical
                            persona, there are some things a Happy Nuclear
                            Warrior can really excel in bringing to the field.
                        </p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Big Ideas, Small Details.</li>
                            <li>Adapting to the Audience.</li>
                            <li>Using a Problem-Solution Framework.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <p>When preparing your remarks, I think it’s helpful to
                            structure the segments of your speech as big ideas
                            followed by small details. A happy warrior excites
                            people with broad ideas grounded in concrete
                            details. The ideas are where the happy warrior
                            brings their passion in, but the details should
                            always be tailored to your audience. People say
                            that knowing your audience tells you how deep into
                            a topic you can go, but I argue that you can and
                            should be going into detail with the knowledge that
                            you shouldn’t be focusing on the same details. A
                            happy warrior takes this one step further by
                            identifying what their audience wants to know or
                            will be excited about hearing your perspective on.
                        </p>

                        <p>Big ideas with small details help the audience know
                            where you are going, and help them piece the
                            details together. What makes the happy warrior
                            stand out here is that they are giving their
                            audience new information or presenting it in a new
                            way that engages the audience. I'm going for the
                            latter in this blog (hopefully people want their
                            audience to be excited and learn new things from
                            their speech), but I think it bears repeating that
                            speakers should go in and try to share something
                            new with the audience if they can. I can think of a
                            few talks I’ve been to where the speaker was just
                            rehashing the same information that I had heard
                            before, and I was not excited to be there. I think
                            that the happy warrior is always trying to bring
                            something new to the table, and that’s what makes
                            them so engaging.
                        </p>


                        <h2>Answering Questions Like a Happy Warrior</h2>

                        <p>
                            While you as a Happy Nuclear Warrior might not
                            always be in the position to take questions, there
                            are some things you can do to make sure you are
                            prepared to answer questions that keep up the
                            Happy Warrior persona.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            When responding to questions there are two
                            competing temptations that I experience: the first
                            is to build my response around data and the second
                            is to tell a personal story. While these urges are
                            not totally at odds, and there are definitely times
                            when one is more appropriate than the other, a
                            Happy Warrior is able to respond to any type of
                            question with a structure that is easy-to-follow
                            and engaging.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Now this begs the question, what makes for an
                            easy-to-follow or engaging response? Let's start
                            with
                            the negative of this question. A hard-to-follow
                            response that isn't engaging is one that is full of
                            irrelevant details or too many tangents. I want to
                            distinguish between a story and a tangent here.
                            Stories directly illustrate the point you are
                            trying to make without introducing too many new
                            details or characters that aren't relevant to the
                            broader subject, but tangents are just
                            that--tangents.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I think that the happy warrior is able to avoid
                            these pitfalls by:
                        </p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>organizing responses with lists,</li>
                            <li>getting to the heart of the question,</li>
                            <li>and offering footholds.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>
                            When responding to questions, structuring your
                            answers with clear lists can help keep your
                            responses focused and organized. This method allows
                            you to address each aspect of the question
                            systematically, making your answers easier to
                            follow and understand. Importantly, there shouldn't
                            be more than 3 or 4 things on the list, otherwise,
                            it is difficult for people to hold each element.
                            Not every response should be in list
                            format, but they should all focus on answering the
                            core of the question directly (hopefully, this is
                            another "no duh" moment). The first step is to
                            think, for a split second, about why the person is
                            asking the question (if it's not clear, ask them to
                            clarify). The next step is to build your answer
                            around details that are relevant to the why. Avoid
                            veering off-topic or providing excessive detail. By
                            addressing the main point succinctly, you show that
                            you value your audience’s time and are confident in
                            your knowledge.

                            When I say footholds, I mean a combination of
                            concrete examples and actionable takeaways (which
                            feed into the inspirational element of the Happy
                            Warrior persona). Illustrating your points
                            with real-world examples helps clarify your message
                            and provides tangible evidence to support your
                            answers. By giving your audience actionable
                            takeaways or practical advice that they can use, you ensure that your responses are not
                            only informative but also useful and applicable to
                            your audience’s needs.

                        <h2>When Should you be One?</h2>

                        <p>
                            While simplicity can be beneficial, ensure that you
                            don’t oversimplify complex issues. It’s important
                            to maintain accuracy and depth in your
                            communication, even while staying positive. In a
                            similar vein, be mindful of not overwhelming your
                            audience with too much information; this goes back
                            to giving the right type of details to your
                            audience. Balance your enthusiasm with clear,
                            concise points to avoid cognitive overload and
                            maintain engagement. While the happy warrior
                            approach is generally positive, there are times
                            when it might not be suitable. For instance, in
                            situations that require somber tones, excessive
                            optimism might come across as insincere.
