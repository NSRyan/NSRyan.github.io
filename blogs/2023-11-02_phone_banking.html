						<p>As students in nuclear science and engineering, discussions about clean energy and climate policy are often directly relevant to our experience. In the past, I've taken part in several phone banks where we were talking directly to our local elected representatives.</p>
						<p></p>
						<p>You are probably already familiar with the concept of a phone bank, so I set out to outline some tips from my past experiences. If you're on the fence about doing one, I hope this gives you a better sense of what it would involve.

							It is rare to find a politician running on nuclear science and energy; there are exceptions of course, but in the US this holds today. This makes your research into their opinions a little more complicated. On the good side, students typically have a license to kill. We are seen as educated but relatively unbiased by corporate money. Having this in mind, and a clear script with an ask, can lead to direct action on the part of your representatives. Often, I have participated in these as reactionary endeavors. I would encourage you to think of some proactive uses for this tool as well.
						<p></p>

						<h2>1. Identify the Issue and Deadlines</h2>

						To kick things off, make sure you're crystal clear on the nuclear science-related issue you're addressing. Understand any looming deadlines, especially if there's a veto possibility or other time-sensitive elements. These constraints will help you organize your campaign efficiently and make your ultimate "ask" of your representatives clear. Let's be real, the people that represent us are very busy and have a huge range of issues to cover. One of the biggest outcomes you should think about is increasing their understanding or literacy on the issue you are calling about.
						<p></p>

						<h2>2. Educate Yourself and Members</h2>

						Dive deep into the specifics of the nuclear science topic, including any relevant bills currently under consideration (especially if they are not the reason you are calling). Ensure that all of your members are well-versed in the nuances of the subject matter. You should develop some level of technical familiarity on the subject, but your focus should be on addressing potential concerns of representatives (how this impacts their constituents is just as important as the technical elements).
						</p>

						<p>
						<h2>3. Identify Committees and Key Politicians</h2>

						Depending on the legislative stage, you should pinpoint the specific committees or the entire legislative body that you need to focus on. Calculate the number of members required for effective outreach (plan for maybe 20 minutes per representative). Research and highlight key politicians who have influence over the relevant legislation (it's nice to talk to sponsors of legislation you like, but they might not need to be on the list of representatives). In the past I have targeted abstain votes, committee chairs, senate/house leadership, and no votes.
						<p></p>

						<h2>4. Leverage Connections</h2>

						You'd be surprised by the connections your group might have. Find out if your members have personal or professional associations with the targeted politicians (you might be surprised who volunteered for a campaign or grew up next door to a representative). Regardless of personal connections, you should also try to assign members to talk to representatives in or near their home districts where possible. One of the first things the representative will ask (in as many words, if not these exactly) if the person calling them is one of their constituents. When you are getting your members up to speed, make sure they know to highlight any such connection (going to school in a district is also a connection).
						<p></p>

						<h2>5. Gather Contact and Voting History</h2>

						Compile comprehensive contact information for the politicians you're targeting (phone number of their capital or home offices, depending on if they're in session, and emails for followups if possible). Alongside these data, gather their voting history on nuclear science-related issues where possible (it doesn't have to be totally comprehensive, but any hints of their position are helpful to your bankers). It's good to also get to know other topics they've been supportive of or involved in. If they support student funding or other environmental things your bankers will be able to relate to, you will be able to have a balanced and well-informed conversation.
						</p>

						<p>
						<h2>6. Develop Discussion Materials</h2>

						Politicians appreciate concise and focused discussions with a clear and personal ask from one of their constituents. Develop clear and specific policy or number-based recommendations related to your nuclear science issue. Your members can then add their insights and commentary to personalize the conversation. This might seem like a daunting step, because it is, so start early and involve as many people to help lighten your workload.
						<p></p>

						<h2>7. Pre-Call Meeting</h2>

						Before the phone banking session, schedule a virtual meeting to go over the campaign details, talking points, and strategies. This can either be a last-minute refresher or a comprehensive briefing session, depending on your team's readiness.
						<p></p>

						<h2>8. Phone Banking Day</h2>

						On the big day, consider using a platform like Zoom with breakout rooms if you don't have a meeting space that would allow for semi-private conversations. Zoom allows each member to have a private space for making calls, but the flexibility to bring in someone else. If they encounter challenging questions, they can message the main room for quick backup assistance. This approach maintains a sense of support and camaraderie throughout the calling process.
						<p></p>

					<p>
						Remember, your goal is to foster productive conversations and convey the importance of nuclear science in a non-partisan manner. Your well-informed stance will enhance your credibility and amplify the impact of your outreach campaign. Good luck, and let your collective voice drive your success!
