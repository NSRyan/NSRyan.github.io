						<p>As students in nuclear science and engineering, discussions about clean energy and climate policy are often directly relevant to our experience. From time-to-time you may feel the need to communicate the will of your members directly to your local elected representatives, and you may feel the desire to do a phone bank. Phone banking is a great way to engage the voices of your members to do some good in your community or state.</p>
						<p></p>
						<p>So what is phone banking? Well, it involves getting together a group of people to go through a list of individuals to inform your representatives about something or influence their opinion.

							Nuclear science and energy are typically bipartisan, and students typically have a social and political license to kill where they are seen as educated but relatively unbiased by corporate money. Having this mindset and a clear script with an ask can lead to direct action on the part of your representatives.
						<p></p>

						<h2>1. Identify the Issue and Deadlines</h2>

						To kick things off, make sure you're crystal clear on the nuclear science-related issue you're addressing. Understand any impending deadlines, especially if there's a veto possibility or other time-sensitive elements. These constraints will help you organize your campaign efficiently and make your ultimate "ask" of your representatives clear.
						<p></p>

						<h2>2. Educate Yourself and Members</h2>

						Dive deep into the specifics of the nuclear science topic, including any relevant bills currently under consideration. Ensure that all members are well-versed in the nuances of the subject matter. You should develop some level of technical familiarity on the subject, but your focus should be on addressing potential concerns of representatives (how this impacts their constituents is just as important as the technical elements).
						</p>

						<p>
						<h2>3. Identify Committees and Key Politicians</h2>

						Depending on the legislative stage, you should pinpoint the specific committees or the entire legislative body that you need to focus on. Calculate the number of members required for effective outreach (if your phone bank is going to be 4 hours, plan for maybe 20 minutes per representative). Research and highlight key politicians who have influence over the relevant legislation (it's nice to talk to sponsors of legislation you like, but they might not need to be on the list of representatives).
						<p></p>

						<h2>4. Leverage Connections</h2>

						You'd be surprised by the connections your group might have. Find out if your members have personal or professional associations with the targeted politicians (you might be surprised who volunteered for a campaign or grew up next door to a representative). Regardless of personal connections, you should also try to assign members to talk to representatives in or near their home districts where possible.
						<p></p>

						<h2>5. Gather Contact and Voting History</h2>

						Compile comprehensive contact information for the politicians you're targeting (phone number of their capital or home offices, depending on if they're in session, and emails for followups if possible). Alongside these data, gather their voting history on nuclear science-related issues where possible (it doesn't have to be totally comprehensive, but any hints of their position are helpful to your bankers). It's good to also get to know other topics they've been supportive of or involved in. This approach allows you to strike a balanced and well-informed conversation.
						</p>

						<p>
						<h2>6. Develop Discussion Materials</h2>

						Politicians appreciate concise and focused discussions with a clear and personal ask from one of their constituents. Develop clear and specific policy or number-based recommendations related to your nuclear science issue. Your members can then add their insights and commentary to personalize the conversation.
						<p></p>

						<h2>7. Pre-Call Meeting</h2>

						Before the phone banking session, schedule a virtual meeting to go over the campaign details, talking points, and strategies. This can either be a last-minute refresher or a comprehensive briefing session, depending on your team's readiness.
						<p></p>

						<h2>8. Phone Banking Day</h2>

						On the big day, consider using a platform like Zoom with breakout rooms if you don't have a meeting space that would allow for semi-private conversations. Zoom allows each member to have a private space for making calls, but the flexibility to bring in someone else. If they encounter challenging questions, they can message the main room for quick backup assistance. This approach maintains a sense of support and camaraderie throughout the calling process.
						<p></p>

					<p>
						Remember, your goal is to foster productive conversations and convey the importance of nuclear science in a non-partisan manner. Your well-informed stance will enhance your credibility and amplify the impact of your outreach campaign. Good luck, and let your collective voice drive your success!
