						<p>Hopefully, you're here to learn a little bit about what to do when attending your first national ANS meeting. This advice is
            probably generalizable to any conference, but take some of the funding and logistics with a grain of salt.</p>

						<p>If this is your first conference all together, good luck and remember to have fun!</p>

							Whether you're a seasoned attendee or a first-timer, this event
							promises an unforgettable experience (with a light caffeine dependence).
							Let's go over some of my tips to make the most of your time at
							this professional technical conference.
						<p></p>

						<h2>1. Make a Plan</h2>

							<p>What’s the phrase (I say in this written medium as if I couldn’t have googled it if I wanted)? If you fail to prepare, you prepare to fail. For conferences, I tell myself "if it's not written down, it’s not going to happen."</p>

							<p>For a conference, I think the most reliable way to get things out of it is to go in with a plan—a written one at that! You should ask yourself what you are trying to get out of the conference (an internship/job offer, new directions for your research, connecting with future employers/mentors, or maybe you’re going because you won some award). After identifying what you are trying to get out of the experience, research the conference agenda, speakers, and topics to identify sessions that align with your goals. If you are like me, it will get written down somewhere, and you can check things off your list, but this works just as well if you have a mental list.</p>
						<p></p>

						<h2>2. Figure out Your Finances</h2>

							<p>Depending on your fellowship/grants/awards/department, your path to the conference will probably look very different than mine. You should always identify supplemental sources of aid. For ANS National conferences, things like the Student program (which I have chaired) and the Diversity in ANS Travel Grant (which I have received) are great ways to lower the barriers to your attendance. Regardless of your situation, you should reach out to other ANS students (either from your school or in our online forums) to find others to split the costs of the hotel with you.</p>

							<p>The Student Program will cover registration costs upfront and reimburse you a set amount for travel so long as you help with a couple sessions (it's easy work)! When you register under the Student Program, sessions may appear full. Fear not! Remember that these choices are about which sessions you'd like to work for the Student Program rather than attend. Opt for the sessions aligned with your interests, and if you don't get your top pick—it's not a deal-breaker (you can always trade later).</p>

							<p>If you're eligible, and the application deadline hasn't passed, don't miss the chance to apply for the DIA travel scholarship. In addition to the student program, this will fund your travel and probably a good deal of your hotel costs. You can find the application on the meeting-specific page.</p>

						<p>
						<h2>3. Attend Sessions and Engage</h2>

							<p>I hope this is a no-duh moment for you, but I have seen students attend conferences and (without a written plan) end up just doing schoolwork during the day and going to the socials at night. I don’t think you should go to every single session, especially if you aren’t interested in the topic, but valuable connections form between you and the people you attend sessions with. You can talk to the researchers whose work you’ve read and reread for years.</p>

							<p>The biggest thing you should do is take notes of ideas, questions, and future research topics. I was in a fuel cycles session once where Monica Regalbuto (a Director of Nuclear Fuel Cycle Strategy at INL) and Eva Davidson (from the Research and Test Reactor Physics Group) kept pausing to point out potential research topics for young researchers to explore, which is a rare happening. At the time of writing, I can’t claim to know them personally, but, at that moment, they were, knowingly or not, helping me to get the most out of an interesting session on fuel cycles.</p>

							<p>If you're in the student program and willing, consider volunteering for those 8 a.m. sessions. By doing so, you'll leave the rest of your day free to immerse in all the conference offerings. It's an excellent way to make the most of your time and enjoy the rest of the event at your leisure.</p>
						<p></p>

						<h2>4. Show up to Division and Committee Meetings</h2>

							<p>The divisions within ANS hold their own virtual/hybrid meetings in the few weeks before the conference; even if you can’t be at the conference, add your division meetings to your calendar. They count towards the student program, but, more importantly, offer valuable face time with other members of your divisions. If you are in the student program, remember to email the meeting leader indicating your participation and request email confirmation for attending the meeting. One of the Student Program cochairs can sign off once you get there.</p>

							<p>What you shouldn’t miss is the Student Sections Committee (SSC) meeting always takes place at 6 p.m. on Monday, and you should absolutely go (even if you're from Oregon State and they have scheduled another social during it; yeah, I’m talking to you). Following the meeting, there’s usually another social event where you'll have the chance to mingle.</p>

							<p>For those curious about the innermost workings of ANS, mark your calendars for the board meeting, Thursday from 8 a.m. to 3 p.m. If you can't make it, the Business meeting on Wednesday (available only at the annual conference) will provide an opportunity to witness the organization answering questions on the record.</p>
						<p></p>

						<h2>5. Network Intentionally and Humanely</h2>
							<p>One of the big reasons people will tell you to go to a conference in person is that they are great for networking. Because it’s a human thing, I don’t think you should have a checklist for what you should do or say in each interaction to maximize or optimize anything (shocking coming from an engineer, I know). What I think people mean when they recommend conferences for the networking experience is the culmination of a couple years of conference attendance when people start to associate you with your area of work and know you. I’ll say, that is not where I am at in my career, but there are people I recognize at conferences in that way, which is a helpful foothold going into the socials.</p>

							<p>While I acknowledge that being known or recognized is valuable for your career, I think the more immediate value to students comes if you are open to conversations and approach people with questions or to discuss shared interests. This knowledge or idea exchange is helpful if you follow up and exchange contact information or connect on LinkedIn to maintain your network. Depending on your area of interest and school, you might be like me in that there’s only a handful of people whose work overlaps with yours. It’s great to connect with people at your school, but other institutions approach the same topic differently. I think it follows that expanding your network outside of your school will push you in new directions for your work.</p>

						<p>
						<h2>6. Present Professionally</h2>
							<p>Dress in business professional attire, as this is an opportunity to make a positive impression on potential employers and peers. Keep in mind that, depending on the conference and crowd, the idea of professional attire will vary wildly. I will maintain that I don’t think you can be overdressed—that could be because I like having excuses to dress up.</p>

							<p>I’m not going to require you to bring copies of your resume, it’s not something I have tried yet, but the kernel of advice here is to ensure you are prepared to discuss your education, skills, and career aspirations. Not every job interview is a job interview if you catch my drift. Visiting the exhibition area will give you opportunities to talk with company representatives and potentially find internship or job opportunities, but you might sit next to them at lunch or be in line with them for coffee.</p>
						<p></p>

						<h2>7. Present Your Research Strategically</h2>
						If you have research or a project to showcase, consider presenting a poster or paper. It's a great way to gain exposure and receive feedback. Don’t rush into presenting before you are ready. Something my advisor and I have had several conversations about is what I need to be prepared with before my first exposure to my subfield in the form of a conference presentation. Some of the biggest things we have discussed are engaging with experts already in the field, being familiar with what the hot-button issues are, and developing a strong command of my subfield's history. Am I an encyclopedia of knowledge? No, but I’m working on it!

						<p></p>

						<h2>8. Reflect and Apply</h2>
						Reflect on what you've learned at the conference and consider how you can apply this knowledge to your coursework, projects, and future career. The key to a successful conference experience is to be proactive, engaged, and open to learning and networking opportunities. I encourage you to assess whether you are meeting these generic goals, you'll get more value out of all of this with ongoing reflection.

						<h2>9. Luggage</h2>

							Check out this <a href="../business_attire.pdf" target="_blank">Business Attire guide</a> for specific clothing recommendations. I always pack a zip lock or grocery bag with dryer sheets in my
							luggage, and, as the conference comes to a close, I layer my luggage with these sheets, and store used undergarments in the grocery bag.
							Your fellow travelers will appreciate it, and it will help preserve any unused clothes or garments.
						<p></p>

						<h2>10. Business Cards</h2>

							In an increasingly digital world, you may not be interested in a physical card that has your information on it, but they are still a common way that people at conferences use to share contact information. You might be wary of printing hundreds of cards with your current institution, but you can get around this by putting your intended graduation date on the card. Try to keep the information general, use a personal professional email, your phone number if you want to, and maybe the link to your website (if you have one).

							<p>I have employed a tool made by a good friend of mine and fellow nuclear engineer, Madeline Lockhart, to add a QR code to my business card called <a href="https://skanz.live/">Skanz</a>. I also have a QR code on my phone so people can download my contact information or resume on the spot. She isn't paying me to say any of this I am just a big fan, and the people you share your business cards with will be too!</p>
