						<p>Hopefully, you're here to learn a little bit about what to do when attending your first national ANS meeting. This advice is
            probably generalizable to any conference, but maybe one of these days I'll make one of these for the Student Conference (which is
            a whole different beast).</p>
						<p></p>
						<p>If this is your first conference all together, good luck and remember to have fun!</p>

							Whether you're a seasoned attendee or a first-timer, this event
							promises an unforgettable experience (with a light caffeine dependence).
							Let's go over some of my tips to make the most of your time at
							this professional technical conference.
						<p></p>

						<h2>1. Unlock Opportunities with the DIA Travel Scholarship</h2>

							If you're eligible, and the application deadline hasn't passed, don't miss
							the chance to apply for the DIA travel scholarship. In addition to the student program, this will fund your travel and probably a good deal of your hotel costs. You can find the application on the meeting specific page.
						<p></p>

						<h2>2. Register for the Student Program</h2>

							The Student Program will cover the cost of registration up front and reimburse you a set amount for travel so long as you help out with a couple sessions (it's very easy work)! When you register under the Student Program,
							all of the sessions may appear full. Fear not! Remember that these choices are
							about which sessions you'd like to work for the Student Program rather than attend.
							Opt for the sessions aligned with your interests, and if you don't get your
							top pickâ€”it's not a deal-breaker (you can always trade later).

						<p>
						<h2>3. Seize the Morning: Volunteer for 8 am Sessions</h2>

							If you're able and willing, consider volunteering for those
							8 am sessions. By doing so, you'll likely snag them, leaving the rest of your day
							free to immerse yourself in all the conference offerings. It's an excellent way to
							make the most of your time and enjoy the rest of the event at your leisure.
						<p></p>

						<h2>4. Read and Re-read the Student Program Details</h2>

							Before diving headfirst into the conference, take a moment to peruse the Student Program's
							summary on the conference website. Still have questions?
							You can always turn to the co-chairs or your friends in Discord or Slack.
						<p></p>

						<h2>5. Consider Attending the Board Meeting</h2>

							For those curious about the innermost workings of ANS, mark
							your calendars for the board meeting, Thursday
							from 8 am to 3 pm. If you can't make it, the Business meeting on Wednesday
							(available only at the annual conference) will provide an opportunity to witness the
							organization answering questions on the record.

						<p>
						<h2>6. A Virtual Prelude: Division Meetings</h2>

							The divisions within ANS hold their own virtual meetings in the few weeks before
							the conference. Don't miss out as they count towards
							the student program, and offer valuable face time with the divisions. Remember to email
							the meeting leader indicating your participation in the student program, and request
							email confirmation for attending the meeting. One of the Student Program cochairs can sign off once you get there.
						<p></p>

						<h2>7. A Must, the SSC Meeting</h2>

							The highly anticipated SSC
							meeting always takes place at 6 pm on Monday, and you should absolutely go (even if you're from Oregon State and they have scheduled another social during it).  Following the
							meeting, an exciting social event awaits, where you'll have the chance to mingle.
						<p></p>

						<h2>8. Pack Your Bathing Suit</h2>

							If there's
							even a hint of a pool at the conference venue, you'll be ready to go.
						<p></p>

						<h2>9. Dress Practically at the ANS Cocktail Reception</h2>

							Tuesday evening brings a delightful treat: the ANS cocktail reception. As you rub
							shoulders with esteemed professionals, remember to dress comfortably. You might even break a sweat on the dance floor, so bring clothes you can move in. Be prepared to go out afterward, as we will likely continue the party
							well into the night.

						<p>
						<h2>10. Ziplock Magic: Dryer Sheets for Your Luggage</h2>

							Before you go, pack a zip lock bag with dryer sheets for your
							luggage. As the conference comes to a close, layer your luggage with these sheets.
							Trust me, your fellow travelers will appreciate it (and it will help preserve any unused clothes or garments).
						<p></p>

						<h2>11. Have a Plan</h2>

							Last but certainly not least, don't be afraid to introduce yourself to people
							you want to meet. If you want an introduction to someone, don't
							hesitate to go for it (or ask someone to introduce you). Go into the conference with a
							list of things you want to accomplish and people you want to meet. My motto is: if it's not written down, it's not going to happen.
						</p>
					<p>
							With these tips in your arsenal, you're ready to make the most of your time at an American Nuclear Society
							Conference. It's going to be a long couple of days, but in a very valuable for your career.
