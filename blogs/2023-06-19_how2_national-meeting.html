            But, hopefully, you're here to learn a little bit about what to do when attending your first national ANS meeting. This advice is 
            probably generalizable to any conference, but maybe one of these days I'll make one of these for the Student Conference (which is 
            a whole different beast).</p>
						<p></p>
						<p>If this is your first conference all together, good luck! I'll likely be around in some capacity, or I am more than happy to 
            connect you to people I know at the meeting.</p>
