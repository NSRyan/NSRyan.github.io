				<p>The process of applying to graduate school seems to be ever-evolving and, at the outset, it was very nebulous to me. Hopefully these little nuggets of advice can be of use to you in your journey!</p>

					Research is the backbone of your graduate school journey, whether you pursue a master's or a Ph.D. degree. It involves asking new questions or exploring novel approaches to existing/never-before-seen problems. Remember, you don't need to have all the answers before starting. Your advisor will help guide you in shaping your research focus. To stay updated with the latest developments in your field, set up <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_alerts?view_op=list_alerts&hl=en" target="_blank">Google Scholar alerts</a> for topics of interest. I recommend you use digest notifications for active keywords, but feel free to adjust based on your preferences.

					<h2>1. Pursuing Fellowships and Awards</h2>

					Fellowships can provide valuable financial support and recognition for your research efforts. If you have been involved in undergraduate research, you might be ready to apply for a fellowship during your senior year. They might not tell you that departments often nominate applicants for awards and fellowships as applications come in, so an early application can work in your favor. Stay proactive in seeking out opportunities for funding and recognition throughout your graduate studies.
				</p>

				<p>
					<h2>2. Presenting and Writing with Precision</h2>

					Developing scientific writing skills is essential for communicating your research findings. Consider enrolling in a free scientific writing course, such as the one on Coursera called "<a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/sciwrite" target="_blank">Writing in the Sciences</a>." Adhere strictly to your department's provided template for your thesis, but feel free to draw on your groupmates for publication or presentation templates. Speaking of your groupmates, remember that presentation and publication practices can vary by student. In my first year, I spent too many hours comparing myself to others much further along in their degree than I was.

					<h2>3. Finding the Right Advisor</h2>

					Finding a suitable advisor is crucial for a successful graduate school experience. One approach is to ask professors in your department whose work aligns with your interests and seek their recommendations. This strategy helps avoid the common challenge of accidentally messaging professors who have moved on or shifted their research focus. Be proactive in meeting with potential advisors, through email or at conferences. Introduce yourself to faculty members, and remember that most are approachable and willing to discuss their work—we're all nerds who get to do what we love for a living.

					<h2>4.  Applying to Grad School</h2>

					Applying to graduate school can feel overwhelming, but proper planning and preparation can alleviate stress. Start early to give yourself ample time to complete the application process. A helpful <a href="https://github.com/gwisk/gradguide" target="_blank">guide for applications</a>, although primarily focused on physics, can provide valuable advice—even if some of the requirements are different. If you encounter confusing websites or outdated information, email the head of graduate affairs or the advisor for clarification.
				</p>
				<p>

					<h2>5. Identifying Suitable Programs and Institutions</h2>

					Begin your search for graduate programs by consulting professors in your department with whom you have a good rapport. If no professors immediately come to mind, consider asking your ANS chapter advisor or department head for recommendations. Gathering insights from faculty members who know your capabilities and aspirations can help you identify suitable programs and institutions for your graduate studies.

				<p>
					<h2>6. Asking Important Questions</h2>

					Throughout your graduate journey, you must seek information that helps you make informed decisions. Here are some questions to consider:

					<ul>
						<li>What is the typical workload in your program?</li>
						<li>How do students balance research and coursework?</li>
						<li>Can you provide examples of research projects undertaken by students in the program?</li>
						<li>What are the faculty like in your department?</li>
						<li>How accessible is funding for research projects?</li>
						<li>What are the job prospects after graduation?</li>
						<li>What is the sense of community among graduate students?</li>
						<li>How does the program support mental health and wellness?</li>
						<li>Are there extracurricular activities available for graduate students?</li>
						<li>What advice do you have for someone starting the program?</li>
					</ul>
				</p>
				<p>
					<h2>7. Miscellaneous Tips and Recommendations</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Embrace social media platforms to connect with professionals and stay updated with the latest research in your field.</li>
						<li>Attend American Nuclear Society (ANS) meetings to engage with the nuclear community and participate in the student program.</li>
						<li>Create a comprehensive CV to showcase your academic and research achievements.</li>
						<li>Establish a personal website for your research, interests, and accomplishments.</li>
						<li>Actively participate in conferences, webinars, and other events to expand your network and gain exposure to diverse perspectives.</li>
						<li>Sending cold emails can be anxiety-inducing; consider asking someone you trust to review your progress, or work together to keep each other accountable.</li>
					</ul>
